# Research-on-Aircraft-Noise-Model--NASA-Summer-Internship-2014
Program titled ModifiedSAR, creates a display of noise pollution at receptor locations as an Aircraft is in flight. 
This project was created by Alexander Zhu in the summer of 2014 at the NASA Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, CA under the supervision of Dr. Neil Chen.
